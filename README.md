# A Simple Book List

A simple book list created with vanilla JavaScript.

Created as part of Brad Traversy's Udemy course, [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/v4/content).

Planned enhancements:
- [ ] Further styling
- [ ] ISBN validation
- [ ] Publication date with validation
- [ ] Timestamp / display when added
- [ ] Display deleted books in new table... hm, make this a legit "to-read" and "read" book list app!
